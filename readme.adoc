# Presentations

Presentations by Max Andersen. Each presentation is archived in separate branches.

The presentations are done using asciidoctor + reveal.js and the whole thing is wired up with a link:src/docs/adoc2reveal.java[JBang script].

The advantage is that you need zero installation and setup for this. No Java, Maven, Ruby, Gems etc. setup. All done and in isolated and in a reproducible manner.

You can run `./index.adoc --serve` and it will download or all necessary and render and serve the presentation on http://localhost:8000 

If you already have jbang installed or running on Windows where the shebang is not supported you can do:

`jbang adoc2reveal.java --serve` 

This will get you a `index.html` generated anytime a `.adoc` file changes. 

You can open it directly from the filesystem, but works best when served from a server.
